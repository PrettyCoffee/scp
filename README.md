### Refined concept

A startpage with different customizable tiles.
~~Each time you create a tile, it will start off as a terminal like text area.~~
You can list available widgets or start a widget in there.

Edit: I decided to go with a full blown UI editor instead of terminals.

Features:

- [x] Resizable tiles
- [x] Positioning of tiles
- [x] Background can be chosen
- [ ] Different usable widgets:
  - [ ] Link tree (like terminal filemanager)
  - [ ] Weather
  - [ ] Clock
  - [ ] Todo list
  - [ ] System fetcher

### Stretch goals

- [ ] Full keyboard support
- [ ] More widgets, e.g.:
  - [ ] Calendar
  - [ ] Planner
  - [ ] Shortcut bar
  - [ ] Spotify widget
  - ...
- [ ] ~~More commands~~
- [ ] Custom icons (pasted svg paths)
- [ ] ~~Terminal autocomplete~~
- [ ] Customizable color theme
- [x] Custom CSS for all tiles
- [ ] Custom CSS for individual tiles
- [ ] Web extension
- [x] [Hero Patterns](https://heropatterns.com/) as background
- [ ] Workspaces as pages for different topics
